### Hi!  🙋🏼‍♂️

My name is **Ignacio Castillo** and I'm a digital communicator from Buenos Aires with broad experience on planning, managing and copy-writing digital content both in English and Spanish. I am currently studying to become a **Front-End Web Developer** by using [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and attending courses at [EducaciónIT](https://www.educacionit.com). Here you will find some of the projects I've been working on while going on this journey.
